# Mx-ESC

The source code for our paper "Enhanced Community Detection in Multiplex
Networks via Tensor Weighted Schatten p-norm".

The paper is under review. 


# Required toolboxes:
The MATLAB code for MV-RTSC needs some toolboxes:

[1] Tensor decomposition, Xie, Y., Tao, D., Zhang, W., Liu, Y., Zhang, L., & Qu, Y. (2018). 
"On unifying multi-view self-representations for clustering by tensor multi-rank minimization."

[2] Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB: <a href="https://www.tensortoolbox.org">www.tensortoolbox.org</a>

# Networks:
All networks used in our paper are available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T8AITuQZCbCB52PELprIVb75d4-6hi20). 
Each netword is a mat file containing 2 variables the djacancy tensor and theground truth label.
